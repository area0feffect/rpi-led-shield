##About

We love Neopixels and have worked with them so much we decided to make a shield for them. The shield allows us to get our prototypes going right away without the need of a breadboard, cobbler setup and extra wires.

There are all sorts of microcontrollers you can use to power WS2811 but we chose Raspberry Pi for it's speed, networking capabilities, threading etc. Also we like Python.

<br/>

##Features
* Works with any WS2811 / WS2812 LED's and Neopixels
* 3 and 4 pin Molex slots for easily swapping out your LED's
* 100uf capacitor to protect against surges while powering
* Inspired by adafruit Neopixels and Fadecandy.
