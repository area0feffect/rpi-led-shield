#HWYD WS2811 BRIDGE: GUIDE
###Prototyping with Neopixels and the Rasperry PI 

This is a guide for using our Raspberry Pi shield designed with LED prototyping in mind. It attaches to the GPIO pins of your Raspberry Pi and acts as a WS2811 Bridge between LED's of your choice. We love prototyping with Neopixels and needed a tool that was easy to use. The shield allows us to get our prototypes going right away without the need of a breadboard, cobbler setup and extra wires.

#NOTE
* Supports Raspbbery Pi A, B/B+, 2 and 3.
* Works with any WS2811 / WS2812 LED's and Neopixels
* 3 and 4 pin Molex slots for easily swapping out your LED's
* 100uf capacitor to protect against surges while powering
* Inspired by adafruit Neopixels and Fadecandy.

We chose Raspberry Pi for it's speed, networking capabilities, 
threading etc. Also we like the flexbility Python offers for web 
and data minded projects.
